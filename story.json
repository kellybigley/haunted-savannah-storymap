This appears as a burst of light and is often times orb shaped. &nbsp;Orb catchers have been witnessed many times at 432 Abercorn, and one has even been captured in a photograph. &nbsp;The photograph shows a large orb with illuminated tentacles radiating outward."},"media":{"url":"images/432-abercorn.jpg","credit":"Kelly Bigley","caption":"432 Abercorn"},
